## Features

- Able to do basic arithmetic
- Clear button feature

### Languages:

**Made in:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Plans

After finishing this, I realised that the eval() function is ["evil"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!) and that the calculator is prone to many errors such as being able to add another operator which shouldn't happen.

Other features I plan on adding in the future:

- Squared and Square root calcuation
- Calculation History
- And many more
